#This means that when we have a missing value in the state column, the measured value is also missing, at least for the Teen Obesity variable. I think I may just assume that this is true for all metrics.

#I went ahead and did this comparison for another variable, which supports my assumption that if a variables location is missing, so is the actually measured metric. No imputation should be used.
